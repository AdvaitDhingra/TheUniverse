# TheUniverse
Simulation of a hypothetical Universe with various initial conditions

This is a simple project to simulate what a hypothetical universe would be like if you gave it certain initial conditions.

## Overview

This project is based on the ROOT framework (repo [here](github.com/root-project/root)) . The layout of the project is also loosley based on that of ROOT, as it is the repo with which I learned most of my C++ skills. You may find some similarities between it's layout and this one.
